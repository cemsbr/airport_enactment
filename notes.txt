It was needed to create 15 cookbooks.

Each cookbook has very similar code.
So we generated a lot of code replication*!
This could be avoided by creating a Chef LWRP.
But it is more advanced Chef feature,
not intended to be used by beginners. 

To replace the $NAME:
sophisticated bash script was need to avoid manual typing on 15 recipes.
generate.sh

* If something change on template, we have to regenerate all the cookbooks.
And we loose all the manual editions on these cookbooks.

Package URL data must be replace by hand.
It is like this on chor spec too.
However, having to open and edit multiple "default.rb" files
is somehow more tiring and error-prone.

So, first idea to avoid manual editing: entering several times the command:
sed -i 's|$PACKAGE_URL|http://sd-49168.dedibox.fr/....jar|' airportbuscompany/attributes/default.rb 

But it was too boring and dangerous too...
So I changed the generate script to read from user the package url and replace on the proper place.
Note, the URLs could be written in generate.sh as the names are.
However, it would require manipulate more complex data structures in shell script, such as dictionaries.
I preferred to avoid it.
Note usually developers are indeed not so shell script hackers (actually, sysadmins are more used with it).

Heterogeneity: all services are JAR services.
But if there was another kind of package,
the deployed would have to write a completely different set of recipes.
